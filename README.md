# Animal Species Prediction

This repository hosts the code for predicting animal species from images using a pre-trained VGG16 model.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the prediction of animal species from images. Key features and components of the project include:

- Use of a pre-trained VGG16 model for species prediction.
- Preprocessing of images to match the input requirements of the model.
- Display of the top predicted animal species and their associated probabilities.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files and directories:

Files:
1. `animal_species_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.

Folders:
1. `sample_images/`: Contains sample JPG images to test the predictions.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- numpy
